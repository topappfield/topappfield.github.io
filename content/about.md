# About

At TopAppField, we believe in **sincerity, respect, honesty, good faith**, and everything that comes all together with **fair play**.
We believe that, in the long term, the truth will prevail.
Many obstacles and challenges lie on this path.
Changes towards a better world happen slowly, the time available is limited, and a substantial amount of patience is required.

To not lose your head and fail miserably, one should be reasonable and pragmatic when following the path of truth and fairness. TopAppField is a pursuit in this direction. We want to survive but at the same time do the right thing.

### App development

Our products are our software applications and systems.
We develop apps for various purposes using various technologies and platforms.
Some apps are for dedicated customers others may be published for general public use.

> Our apps are designed for their users.

Users are of the foremost importance when designing an app.
Functionalities of an app should be designed in such a way as to support user activities while not obstructing them.
Negative side effects and collateral damage of a product use should be minimized.

To be more concrete, we pursue goals such as:
* avoid ad-based product monetization
* avoid no hidden costs
* openly present options
* design intuitive and easy-to-use user interface
* apply smooth user experience
* optimize code and algorithms.

In particular, we believe that ad-based product monetization is really bad for the people and the society as a whole.
We also hate watching ads.

> User is not a product.

We disagree with the exploitation of users and their data.
Any collected user data may be used to improve user experience with an app, but not sold to third parties just for the purposes of making money.

### Who are we?

TopAppField is an application development endeavor with the above goals in mind.
We also do this because we like doing it.
Of course, if in the future our endeavor becomes financially sustainable, this would make us very happy as it would also indicate that our vision and goals are the right ones.

Currently, TopAppField is mostly a solo project with a help of a few friends.
Our work includes everything from app development, website design, marketing, and many other activities yet to learn.
