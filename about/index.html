	<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Hi, there!</p>
<p>Not so long ago under a bright full moon üåù, exactly at the midnight and after a glass of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha">kombucha</a> üç∫ with friends, here, in a tiny village of <strong>Topfield</strong> an absolutely brilliant idea üí° on improving this amazing world üåç was brought to its existence.
To put it in simple words, the idea uttered was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's <strong>make</strong> some <strong>apps</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's make some apps with the sole purpose of pleasing the software appetite of all sincere people üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶.
To fulfill this noble goal, me, myself, and I as well as their inexact duplicates, and our friendly companions joined forces in an experimental endeavor called <strong>TopAppField</strong> in order to solemnly articulate our main life-fulfilling purpose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have <strong>fun</strong> while doing <strong>serious</strong> stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our <strong>serious stuff</strong> is the development of software applications and systems.
Fortunately, it is also our <strong>enjoyment</strong>.
It's great fun to make apps and it includes many pleasing activities such as programming and designing as well as some less gratifying ones such as finding boring bugs üêû and admitting your own mistakes.
Nevertheless, the whole process is, generally, really an enjoyable experience.
And, that's a good thing, right? <a href="https://memegenerator.net/instance/31774265/tealc-indeed">Indeed</a>, it is.</p>
<p>In what follows, we wish to present our tele-<strong>vision</strong> üñ• and a few of our <strong>principles</strong> that form the foundation of our public operations and activities.</p>
<h3 id="our-vision-and-principles">Our vision and principles</h3>
<p>Every serious enterprise should clearly state its vision. So, here it is.
<em>For us this is: by making top-quality software, to better the world (at least by a small bit) while doing no harm (as little as possible).</em>
Sounds familiar, huh? Yes, so let's be a bit more concrete.</p>
<p>While saving the world, we follow several principles which we dare to describe below. The first one to start with is</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Respect</strong> all people, especially our <strong>customers</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely! And our customers are the users of our apps.
Let us explain. Our design goal is to avoid developing app features without a clear benefit explicitly intended for the users.
Unfortunately, nowadays, oftentimes, the user becomes the product since the app is, for example, collecting user data, showing ads, etc.
We don't want that.
Any collected user data may be used only to improve the user experience, but not be sold to third parties just for the purposes of making money.</p>
<p>Some more examples of the consequences of the "respect" principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid hidden costs for the users</li>
<li>openly present options to the users</li>
<li>avoid ads since they consume precious user time</li>
<li>support data sovereignty</li>
<li>protect user data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our next principle, extends the respect from the people also to the environment, the nature üåø, the galaxy ü™ê, and all the things around us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apply <strong>sustainable computing</strong> principles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For us, this means that our goal is to make quality apps that are reusable, environment-friendly, optimized for resource usage, etc.
As above, we state some examples of more concrete directions</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid ads since they consume network bandwidth, processor time</li>
<li>optimize code and use efficient algorithms and data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, our last principle talks about our way of doing things</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use <strong>lean design and engineering</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the principle of minimal interference and minimal action while doing just enough to get the job <strong>well done</strong>.
Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>design intuitive and easy-to-use user interface</li>
<li>provide a smooth user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="who-are-we">Who are we?</h3>
<p>Currently, TopAppField is mostly a solo endaveour, but of course, with an occasional help of a few friends.
Our work includes everything from app development, website design, marketing, and many other activities yet to learn.
(Un-)fortunately, we have our daily jobs for our living.
Nevertheless, we would consider a success if in the future somebody (not necessarily me) could be fully employed to work on our projects.</p>
<p>If you wish to contact us, you may write an email to <a href="mailto:info@topappfield.com?subject=Info">info@topappfield.com</a>.</p>
<p>Be fun-wise!</p>
